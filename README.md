# Epilepsy Treatment Classification

epilepsi.csv containt 4 features: base, age, seizure.rate, period  
Based on these features, the developed model classifies whether the patient is getting a real or fake treatment.  

**4 different models have been created for this class project:**  

1) SVM
2) KNN
3) Logistic Regression
4) Gaussian Naive Bayes

We wanted to show that first 2 models are the best approach for a simple binary classification like this. Since we have neither continous nor skewed data, LR and GNN performed very poorly expectedly.
